# PICO Rocq formalization:

This repository contains Coq/Rocq formal proofs for the [PICO](https://github.com/opprop/immutability) project by extending Featherweight Java with subtyping, mutable state, statements, and viewpoint adaptation.

Each subdirectory is for different stages for proof mechanization, where checkmark means it is finished proving.
* pico-nosubtyping-limitedvpa âœ…
* pico-nosubtyping-fullvpa
* pico-full

For building each version of formalization, see README.md in each subdirectory.
